# HollywoodLife_Data_Retrive
In this project I will create python script that is able to get data from Hollywood Life using WP API. This script will save downloaded data into csv file for further analysis or other purposes.

The script provided in this post will be doing the following steps:

1. Get data from blog using WP API and request from urlib

2. Save json data as the text file.

3. Open the saved text file, read json data, extract needed fields(such as title, content) and save extracted information into csv file.
