# HollywoodLife_Data_Retrive
In this project I  create python script that is able to get data from Hollywood Life using Wordpress API. This script will save downloaded data into csv file for analysis.

The script will be doing the following steps:

Step1. Get data from http://hollywoodlife.com/ using WP API and request from urlib

Step2. Save json data as the text file.

Step3. Open the saved text file, read json data, extract fields and save extracted information into csv file.

Also, I use BeautifulSoup to crawl webpage information. You can see the script as HollywoodLife_Page_Detail.py.
