Before this iconic diva steps on stage, get all the details about the \u201cGodmother of soul.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. She&#8217;s a chart-topping legend<\/strong>. Born Patricia Louise Holt, Patti began singing after joining a local church choir in her native home of Philadelphia. Since her first single in 1962, Patty has gone on to win two Grammy awards, a ton of Lifetime Achievement awards and, in 2004, she was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. She&#8217;s best known for her songs &#8220;On My Own,&#8221; &#8220;Stir It Up,&#8221; &#8220;The Best Is Yet To Come&#8221; and &#8220;New Attitude.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Patti began as part of a girl group<\/strong>. Long before <strong>Beyonce <\/strong>and Destiny\u2019s Child or <strong>Camila Cabello<\/strong> and Fifth Harmony, there was Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles. The group scored a hit with 1962\u2019s \u201cI Sold My Heart To The Junkman.\u201d They would rename themselves as simply <strong>Labelle<\/strong> in 1971, and would find their first No. 1 song with <a href=\"http:\/\/hollywoodlife.com\/2015\/04\/28\/dwts-patti-labelle-performance-lady-marmalade-dwts-lil-kim-amber-riley-dancing-with-the-stars\/\">the original \u201cLady Marmalade.\u201d<\/a> The song would later be covered by <strong>Christina Aguilera, Lil\u2019 Kim, Mya, <\/strong>and <strong>Pink<\/strong> for the film, <em>Moulin Rouge. <\/em>Labelle was so successful, they became the first African-American vocal group to land on the cover of <em>Rolling Stone<\/em>, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.biography.com\/people\/patti-labelle-537586\">Biography.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. She went solo in 1977<\/strong>. Patti decided to go it alone in the late 70s, releasing her self-titled debut. It was a critical success, and since then, she has continued to record and perform, making her a staple of R&amp;B and soul music. She earned her first No. 1 album in 1986 with <em>Winner In You<\/em>, thanks in part to the power of the \u201cOn My Own\u201d single. It\u2019s also her best-selling album to date, going on to sell more than 8 million copies.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. She actually got shady about <em>American Idol<\/em> years ago<\/strong>. \u201cSome of the judges, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re qualified to even judge,\u201d Patti said about <em>Idol<\/em> in 2010, per <a href=\"http:\/\/www.today.com\/id\/35566566\/ns\/today-today_entertainment\/t\/patti-labelle-some-idol-judges-not-qualified\/\"><em>Today<\/em><\/a>. She wouldn\u2019t really explain which judge she was talking about, and at the time, it was Simon Cowell, Randy Jackson, Kara DioGuardi and Ellen DeGeneres picking the winners. Patti said she asked to be a judge on the show before Paula Abdul joined, but a rep for the show at the time declined to comment on the claim.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe comments that were made,\u201d Patti said about the judges\u2019 remarks, \u201cthey could make you like wanna kill yourself.

As you may know, the two are good friends with Mendes, which is why their reaction to his performance was so, as some would say &#8220;extra.&#8221; Criss was minding his own business, when he suddenly couldn&#8217;t see the stage. So, what does anyone do these days when that happens? \u2014 Videotape it, of course. He posted to\u00a0Instagram and tweeted a video that showed him playfully asking Tay\u00a0to move out of the way. \u201cUh, miss? Miss? Uh, excuse me, miss? Miss, I can\u2019t see. I\u2019m trying to watch Shawn Mendes,\u201d Criss said in the video.<\/p>\n<p>Taylor, the surprise \u00a0guest of the night at the BBMAs, won big. She took home the awards for &#8220;Top Female Artist&#8221; and Top Selling Album (Reputation)&#8221;. Tay turned heads on the red carpet when she surprised photogs in a plunging\u00a0pink Versace gown with feather detail and a sultry thigh-high slit. Tay hit the BBMAs right after she put on a stellar Rose Bowl performance, which featured surprise duets with <strong>Selena Gomez<\/strong>, 25, Shawn Mendes and more.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Criss enjoyed the BBMAs and even had a chance to relax in the audience since he did not perform last night. Nonetheless, he&#8217;s gearing up to head out on the road with his friend and <em>Glee<\/em> co-star, <strong>Lea Michelle<\/strong>, 31, for a tour that&#8217;s sure to be epic.
